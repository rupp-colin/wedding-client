        We by no means need gifts. However, we know that traditions die
        hard and by no means want to take the joy of gift giving away from
        anyone. We have a small registry you can access through the
        link below if gift-giving makes you happy.
      </p>
      <a className="registryLink" href="https://www.macys.com/wgl/registry/guest/7075962">Kelsey and Colin's Registry</a>
      <p>
        Also, if you would like to shop elsewhere, please know that you can remove things
        from our registry if needed.
