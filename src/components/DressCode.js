      <p>
        We hate being confused by dress codes, so I'm really going to break this
        down for you. We are hoping women will wear dresses/pantsuits/skirts and men
        will wear button up shirts with relatively nice pants or shorts (Nicer jeans are fine.)
        We would love it if you had some fun with it and wore something with a fun
        pattern or with a bit of color. Foresty/rustic themes are also encouraged.
        The majority of our venue is not paved, so we highly encourage flats for the ladies,
        but if you feel like you can rock heels in that, more power to you (looking
        at you Kendall.)
      </p>

        We have been told we can expect the weather to be about 10 degree's cooler
        than it is in Portland, so expect it to be in the upper 70's to lower 80's.
        There is a stream that runs by the venue that you can dip your toes in to,
        so if that idea appeals to you, dress accordingly.
